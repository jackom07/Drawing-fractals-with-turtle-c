# turtle_git

## This program uses a turtle library to draw fractal shapes with variable colours and depths.

## The turtle library here was based heavily on code by Mike Lam for James Madison University.
## Original source code found here: https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs240_2015_08/turtle.html

## SDL2 handles the display and user key inputs, thus the program will only work using SDL2.
## The SDL2 source code can be found here: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.26.4

## There are limitations and issues with particularily the koch curve algorithm, meaning for many depth values it will not work.
## Furthermore the program is finnicky and the SDL key inputs have to be performed in a specific order as the instructions state.
